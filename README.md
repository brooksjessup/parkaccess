# East Bay Regional Park Accessibility
*An accessibility analysis of the East Bay Regional Park District*

## 1. Problem Statement
Public parks are not just a luxury, but a necessity. Like schools, clean water, and other forms of critical infrastructure, local parklands provide benefits that are essential to the health, climate, and economy of their surrounding communities. However, recent research shows that access to parks remains highly inequitable in major metropolitan areas across the United States. For example, a recent study by The Trust for Public Land found that people living in predominantly minority and low-income neighborhoods have access to over 40% less park acreage on average than residents of predominantly white and high-income neighborhoods.[^1]

The present study analyzes the accessibility of a particular park system, the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD). Located to the east of the San Francisco Bay in Northern California, EBRPD comprises 73 parks spanning 125,000 acres across Alameda and Contra Costa counties. Unlike the local city parks that are the focus of most park accessibility studies, the regional parks of EBRPD are not simply recreational greenspaces embedded within urban neighborhoods, but rather pockets of open wildlands that surround and separate the dense urban communities of the SF Bay Area. Thus, although one of the main goals of EBRPD is to provide access to these rich natural resources for the 2.8 million residents living within its two-county service area, the park district also has an equally important duty to protect and preserve these lands from human impact at the same time.[^2]

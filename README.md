# East Bay Regional Park Accessibility
*An accessibility analysis of the East Bay Regional Park District*

## 1. Problem Statement
Public parks are not just a luxury, but a necessity. Like schools, clean water, and other forms of critical infrastructure, local parklands provide benefits that are essential to the health, climate, and economy of their surrounding communities. However, recent research shows that access to parks remains highly inequitable in major metropolitan areas across the United States. For example, a recent study by The Trust for Public Land found that people living in predominantly minority and low-income neighborhoods have access to over 40% less park acreage on average than residents of predominantly white and high-income neighborhoods [^1].
